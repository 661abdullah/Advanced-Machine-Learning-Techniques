# Project Advanced Machine Learning Techniques

Welcome to my GitHub repository for Project 6! In this project, I've taken a deep dive into advanced machine learning techniques using a rich dataset. My focus was on building robust models, experimenting with ensemble methods, designing neural networks, and bringing high-dimensional data to life through visualizations.

## What's Inside

- **Data Prep**: I start off by loading the data, normalizing pixel values, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets for a balanced approach.
- **Building Models**: I experiment with various models to find what works best for the task at hand.
- **Ensemble Magic**: By combining several models, I aim to boost prediction accuracy beyond what any single model could achieve.
- **Neural Networks**: I design a neural network tailored to our specific data needs, exploring the architecture that maximizes performance.
- **Hyperparameter Heaven**: Tuning hyperparameters helps squeeze every bit of accuracy out of the models.
- **Visual Insights**: Using PCA and t-SNE, I transform complex dataset patterns into understandable 2D visuals.

## Setup

Make sure you have `sklearn`, `tensorflow` or `keras`, and `matplotlib` installed to follow through with the notebook. These tools are essential for the machine learning processes and visualizations I've implemented.

## How to Use This Notebook

1. **Start with Data**: Dive into the preprocessing steps to get the data ready for models.
2. **Experiment with Models**: Build and test various models, using ensemble techniques to enhance the results.
3. **Tune and Design**: Focus on designing a neural network and fine-tuning its parameters for optimal results.
4. **Visualize**: Take advantage of PCA and t-SNE to see the bigger picture in a more digestible format.
